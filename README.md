## Reflection 

Sometimes ago i was using the <a target="_blank" href="http://dontpad.com/">DontPad</a> and i was thinking about: If i had somethig likely but with a login, to protect my anotations or share only with my permition. Because this, i'm building the Real Type

This a very important project to me becouse, i'm learning about a lot of technologies like database, Context API, JWT and more
